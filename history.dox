/**	@page History		@section two Version 0.91		Adjusted comment processing to include the trailing asterisk and backslash.	This fixes a case or two where the output would be missing the trailing 	comment termination (most notably the file comment when using the -p option).	Fixed bug in command line logic - passing no parameters did nothing, instead	of attempting to process stdin to stdout.		Some cleanup of Doxygen comments		@section one Version 0.9		Initial public release.*/
